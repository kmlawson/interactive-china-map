# interactive-china-map
 Interactive modern China map for students.

Designed to help students prepare for a map quiz. See the about section of the page for more information on the sources of the images. Requires only a web server and a JavaScript active browser. Should work ok on mobile but occasional funky location of label when the user zooms in. 

Province (white label) and city names (yellow) appear as labels on mouseover. 

Taiwan is included since this was designed for a modern Chinese history module and students need to know where and what it is too.
